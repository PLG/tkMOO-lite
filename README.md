tkMOO-lite-PLGd
===============

This started out as just a hack to get the keyboard shortcuts to work,
but has ended up as a major revision (for MacOSX)

- removed backward compatibility... needs at least wish8.5
- fixed Mac keyboard shortcuts
- changed menus and keyboard shortcut behavior for fast MOO editting
- added Automator MacApp installer

I must also add that I have never wasted as much time on such unreadable
code in my life. Overloading menu creation code, hardcode entry labels,
and no comments cost me a single solid day of headache. ARGH!
