Installing tkMOO-light-PLGd on MacOSX
==============================

Of course Mac is *nix-based. But, I thought I would make it a bit easier on myself running Mac.
So, I added a Automator Mac App.

  'mac macinst' will install a Automator Mac App in the ~/Applications folder.

  'make macclean' will erase the previous changes made by 'macinst'


Installing tkMOO-light on UNIX
==============================

If you can read this file then you've successfully unpacked the
distribution's .tar.gz archive.  Unpacking the .tar.gz archive
produces the following files:

  ./README.md           Important information.
  ./INSTALL.unix        This file.
  ./LICENCE             The software licence, PLEASE READ THIS.
  ./source.tcl          The client software.  
                        'make' converts this script into a runnable form.
  ./bugsmail.txt        Email template for reporting bugs.
  ./plugins/            A directory containing some plugin scripts for the client.
  ./dot.tkmoolightrc    examples of Tk resource settings.  
                        Rename to '.tkmoolightrc' if you'd like to use these settings.

On Unix:

  Edit the Makefile to set values for TKMOO_LIB_DIR, TKMOO_BIN_DIR and WISH

  'make' will build the executable tkMOO-lite .

  'make install' will copy the executable and icon files to the TKMOO_LIB_DIR .
